    "This project will analyze water consumption in egypt, we will try to answer those questions:\n",
    "1. What is the resources for water in Egypt?\n",
    "2. What is the water withdrawal in agricultural, industrial, municipal compared to each other in Egypt?\n",
    "3. How much water we use in agriculture's products and irrigation?\n",
    "4. How much rainfall water we use and How we can store it?\n",
    "5. How much underground water we use, and how much desert area do we have in Egypt? \n",
    "6. How climate change and pollution affect the water?\n",
